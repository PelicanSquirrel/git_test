Learning about staging, commiting, and pushing

First is to get the remote repository
- $ git clone git@github.com:USER_NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git

To stage a file is to put it in a waiting room
- $ git add <file_name>:  stages the file
- $ git status: displays the current status 
    - Red: hasn't been staged for commit
    - Green: staged for commit

After the file is staged, it can be commited.
- $ git commit -m "Description of changes"

Finally you can push it
- $ git push origin main
